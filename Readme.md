## To create ppi networks

run the create_ppi_graphs.py 

## To create cleaned bio-tissue-hierachy

run the check_connected_components.py

## To compare with graph_matching.py
- checks between nodes, edges, structure, and degree 
make sure the ppi networks and the cleaned bio tissue hierachy is created

## To compare with graph_pattern_matching.py
- checks using the dict of patterns I found from the edge lists
make sure the ppi networks and the  bio tissue hierachy is created

## To investigate the files
run ppi_graph_investigation.py and uncomment sections about the different files
